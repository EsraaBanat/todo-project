            <p>As you might have realized at some point in your life, managing your tasks is not child’s play. It’s
                actually a lot of
                work and, if you don’t have the necessary skills, it can end up damaging your team’s and your company’s
                results.

                It’s easy to procrastinate, waste too much time on not-so-important activities and be less productive
                than the ideal.
                Organizing and preparing yourself may seem unnecessary, but don’t fall for it. Proper task management
                allows you to view
                your team’s tasks from a different angle and helps you plan ahead.

                Ok, don’t freak out just yet. Task management is not a three-headed dragon and mastering it will only
                take a bit of
                patience and working with a few tricks of the trade.
